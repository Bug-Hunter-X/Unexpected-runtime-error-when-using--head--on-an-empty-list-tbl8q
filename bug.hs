```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print (head ys)
```
This code snippet seems innocuous enough. It sorts a list and then prints the head of the sorted list. However, it contains a potential error: it doesn't handle the case where the list is empty. Calling `head` on an empty list results in a runtime exception.
